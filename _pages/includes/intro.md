# 👨‍🎓 About Me
Hi! I am currently a master's student at School of Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, advised by [Prof. Zhonghong Ou](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/ouzhonghong/zh_CN/index.htm). I received my bachelor’s degree from the same school in 2023. 
In addition, I am working as a research intern at [AIR-DREAM Lab](https://air-dream.netlify.app/) of Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Xianyuan Zhan](http://zhanxianyuan.xyz/).

My research interest includes Embodied AI and Computer Vision. My long-term goal is to build generalist embodied agents in the physical world, with the ability to perform generalizable vision-language understanding, robust action execution, and reliable long-horizon planning.
